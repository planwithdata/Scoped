DATA SOURCES TO INTEGRATE
=========================

GOVERNMENT SOURCES (INDIA):
- Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)
- India Meteorological Department (IMD)
- Central Ground Water Board
- National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)
- Census data and demographic information
- Ministry of Environment data portals

OPEN SOURCE APIS:
- OpenWeatherMap (weather data)
- NASA Earth Data (satellite imagery)
- World Bank Open Data
- UN Sustainable Development Goals data
- OpenStreetMap (infrastructure data)
- Natural Earth (geographic boundaries)

SATELLITE & REMOTE SENSING:
- Sentinel satellite data (ESA)

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY (REVISED)
=================================

WEEK-BY-WEEK DEVELOPMENT:
Week 1: Healthcare & Education Proximity (OSM)
Week 2: Public Transportation Access (OSM)
Week 3: Essential Services Access (OSM)
Week 4: Weather & Climate Integration (OpenWeatherMap)
Week 5-8: Environmental data expansion
Week 9-12: Advanced environmental features
Week 13-16: Safety and economic proxies

ITERATIVE DEVELOPMENT:
1. Prioritize high-availability data sources first
2. Build on existing OSM integration
3. Add one major feature per week
4. Test and validate each addition
5. Maintain performance and user experience

TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Implement caching to handle multiple API calls
- Add data quality indicators and confidence scores
- Create fallback mechanisms for unavailable data
- Optimize for mobile performance
- Add offline capability for core features

SCORING SYSTEM EVOLUTION:
- Dynamic weight adjustment based on location type (urban/rural)
- User preference customization
- Seasonal adjustments for climate-dependent factors
- Regional calibration for different geographic areas

VALIDATION & ACCURACY:
